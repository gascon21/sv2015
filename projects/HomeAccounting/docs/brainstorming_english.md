# Home accounting, brainstorming

## Planned features, first contact

+ Record expenses and incomes (grouped in a single option?)
+ View latest expenses (20 by default?)
+ View monthly result (choose year and month)
+ View balance (total per account)

+ First version in console mode
+ Plain language, avoiding technical words
+ Desirable: simple main menu (no more than 8 options, even 6 if possible)
+ Record predictions (later)
+ Save data (encrypted and password request?) (later)
+ Multilingual (at least Spanish and English) (later)
